The former idol, Miru Kasumi, who recently transferred to this school, is not normal.

\“Nice to meet you. I\’ll monopolize your views! I\’m Miruffy!\”

\“Thanks for everything! May I sign your uniform?\”

She has extraordinary style and beautiful eyes like jewels. What\’s more, her unique extraordinary demeanor was so far from ordinary everyday life, and it all looked abnormal. ────I thought.

\“Hmm, I think this might be the first time I\’ve seen someone who isn\’t blushing after getting fan service.\”

\“Hey, will you make me a \‘normal\’ girl?\”

And then the production began. Looking for entertainment on weekends and cultural festivals. When I teach Kasumi about normal high school life, my \“normal\” everyday life also changes… This is a story about the beginning of me and Kasumi\’s changing youth."
