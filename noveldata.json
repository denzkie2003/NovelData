With that, he can act wisely to live a life that is far from all the problems that will come to him.\n\nAt first glance, Rurina seemed like the type of person who couldn’t succeed due to her lack of social skills. But strangely, she always looked up at him excitedly thinking “I want to be friends with Kaburagi-kun!”\n\nTalking about Rurina again, she’s a pretty girl but difficult to be approached and doesn’t get along. He often glared at Kaburagi-kun’s seat, but actually──.\n\n(Kaburagi-kun, your sleeping face is so cute…I want to see it all the time)\n\nAgainst his will, this ability is passively activated, thus repeatedly making Kaburagi feel uncomfortable.\n\nAnd of course, those beautiful thoughts── Kaburagi-kun could hear them too!",

With her long silver hair, mesmerizing blue eyes, and exceptionally fair skin, she has captured the hearts of countless male students while being highly admired by all others. Even so, due to her seemingly unapproachable persona, everyone remains wary around the near-flawless girl.\n\nOne of the few exceptions is Alisa’s benchmate Masachika Kuze, a relatively average boy who spends his days watching anime and playing gacha games. Despite his nonchalant demeanor, Masachika is the sole student to receive Alisa’s attention. Unable to be fully honest, Alisa is frequently harsh on Masachika and only expresses her affection in Russian. Unbeknownst to her, however, Masachika actually understands the language yet simply pretends otherwise for his own amusement.\n\nAs the odd pair continues to exchange witty and playful remarks, their relationship gradually grows more romantic and delightful—and Alisa might finally learn to freely convey her true feelings.",
